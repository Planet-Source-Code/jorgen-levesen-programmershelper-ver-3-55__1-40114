### Description

This is an update to a previous upload.

I have corrected most of the errors some of you were kind enough to point out - and added some new futures. The code snippets database is now re-worked and includes some 2000 snippets as well as a special section, which takes care of some 500 API calls. This code is yours for the taking, do not bother to vote - but feedback is most welcome. Have a nice day
